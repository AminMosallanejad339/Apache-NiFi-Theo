## üéØ Learning Path

### **Beginner Level: Setup and Basics**

**Objective**: Get NiFi running and create your first data flows.

#### Installation and Setup

- Download and install Apache NiFi from [nifi.apache.org](https://nifi.apache.org)
- Configure basic settings in `nifi.properties`
- Setup SSL for secure access
- Familiarize yourself with Web UI: canvas, component toolbar, and operation palette

#### First Data Flows

- Create a simple flow: `GenerateFlowFile ‚Üí PutFile`
- Understand **FlowFiles** and their attributes
- Practice **Expression Language** for basic transformations
- CSV file ingestion, processing, and transformation

#### Core Concepts

- Processors, Connections, Relationships
- Controller Services configuration
- Process Groups for modular flow organization
- Monitor flow performance and bulletins

---

### **Intermediate Level: Core Components Mastery**

**Objective**: Deep dive into processors and build complex flows.

#### Processor Categories

- **Input Processors**: `GetHTTP`, `ListenHTTP`, `GetFile`
- **Output Processors**: `PutSQL`, `PutKafka`, `PutS3Object`
- **Transformation Processors**: `JoltTransformJSON`, `QueryRecord`
- **Routing Processors**: `RouteOnAttribute`, `RouteOnContent`

#### Controller Services

- Disaster recovery planning

---

### **Expert Level: Custom Development and Optimization**

**Objective**: Extend NiFi capabilities and optimize for enterprise scale.

#### Custom Processor Development

- Java-based processor creation
- NAR packaging and deployment
- Testing and validation strategies

#### API Automation

- REST API for flow management
